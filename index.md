## Research
**[Palucis Planetary Geomorphology Research Group](http://www.marisapalucis.com/research), Dr. Marisa Palucis, Dept. of Earth Sciences, Dartmouth College** <br>
_**PhD Candidate**_ | September 2022 - Present <br>
> Reconstructing the transport history of rounded basaltic pebbles on Mars to provide insight into the prevailing martian climate at the time of transport and deposition. We are using laboratory experiments and field campaigns at terrestrial analog environments to advance the state of knowledge regarding basaltic clast transport and abrasion, providing key insights into deciphering the past fluvial conditions on Mars.

**[Planetary Surface Processes Research Group](https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/horgan/), Dr. Briony Horgan, Dept. of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Purdue University** <br>
_**Undergraduate Researcher**_ | May 2020 - Dec 2021 <br>
> Evaluated the mineralogical and morphological presence of hydrated silica in the Melas Chasma of Valles Marineris on Mars. This research gave insight into the history of hydrothermal and lacustrine aqueous environments on Mars and may imply possibilities for astrobiological discoveries.

**[Darryl Granger Research Group](https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/people/profile/dgranger.html), Dr. Darryl Granger, Dept. of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Purdue University** <br>
_**Undergraduate Researcher**_ | Feb 2019 - Dec 2021 <br>
> Mapped the distribution of lake sediments that would allow an accurate dating and elevation calculation of Lake Tight, a Pleistocene pro-glacial lake in what is present-day Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia. We found evidence of crustal flexure due to glacial ice through field-based analysis of surficial lake sediments as well as within cave systems.
